# CSE-494---Project
Implementation to Date:

	To date almost all the visual components of our anime visualization have been completed. The First two to be completed were the scatter plot and the bar graph, which were worked on concurrently and completed on schedule with some minor debugging such as linking and animations still required. Additionally the chord graph was recently completed in its simplest form with no enabled interactions. The axis choice interactions for the bar and scatter plot are enabled but need some debugging due to the large amount of data causing issues with the animations. The work that still needs to be completed includes the animation debugging and linking everything to the chord chart.


Changes to Date:

	The design of the dashboard has remained largely the same with a few key exceptions. The first change was the way we formatted the preprocessing data, opting for a single csv containing all the connections and their weights, then deriving the unique node names from that csv upon runtime. The second change is the linking of our filters to both the bar graph and the scatter plot rather than just the scatter plot to add more interaction to the dashboard. Outside of these two changes the rest of our visual structure remains the same and all the interactions remain fundamentally the same.
